## Obsidian Header Format

Use Typora-like hotkeys to format the current line as a header.
Note that this plugin is different from [Format Hotkeys](https://github.com/anstosa/format-hotkeys-obsidian) in following ways:

1. Different default hotkeys: Mine are `CTRL+0` through `CTRL+6`.
2. Hotkeys toggle by default. This is the behaviour that Typora has, and what I'm used to.

Plugin has been written to learn how to write plugins. Tested on Windows, with Obsidian v0.12.12 and v0.13.14!
